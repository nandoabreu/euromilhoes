This paper responds to the course project for the Time Series and Forecast course,
ministered by the Professor Maria Eduarda Silva, for UP - Universidade do Porto.

## Assignment

Choose a time series of your interest and write a concise report
(pdf, max 6 pages, including appendices) describing
the exploratory analysis of the time series.

### The time series

The time series here employed has data for Euromilh√µes draws in Portugal. The data set,
a [CSV file](../data/euromilhoes.pt.csv), holds data from 2004 to October 2023, but the present study
will consider draws between 2018 and 2022.

In the period of our study, the time series shows events twice a week. There are 522 events in the serie.
