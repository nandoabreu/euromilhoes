This paper responds to the course project for the Time Series and Forecast course,
ministered by the Professor Maria Eduarda Silva, for UP - Universidade do Porto.


## The Project
### Objective
To forecast a real time series using appropriate approaches such as exponential smoothing
and statistical models (ARIMA models).

- Part 1 to be submitted up to 2023-11-03
